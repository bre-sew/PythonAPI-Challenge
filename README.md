## WeatherPy Challenge
This analysis aims to determine if there is correlation between latitude and different meteorological conditions. 
The finding is that as you get further from the equator, the max temperature rises. 
However, there is no linear correlation between latitude and humidity, latitude and cloudiness, or latitude and wind speed.
## VacationPy Challenge
This challenege identifies the best places to go on vacation based on your ideal weather conditions.
It then provides details on the nearest hotel to each location.
All data overlays a heat map weighted by humidity.
